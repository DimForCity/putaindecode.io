Again, ES6 brings us more syntax sugar, that you might appreciate when creating
new object.

## Shorter property name

When you create an object, you might create a variable and then reuse it to
define a property of an object that have the same name.

```js
var firstname = "Robert";
var lastname = "Laiponje";

return {
  firstname: firstname,
  lastname: lastname
};
```

Thanks to ES6, you can directly write:

```js
const firstname = "Robert";
const lastname = "Laiponje";

return {
  firstname,
  lastname
};
// { firstname: "Robert", lastname: "Laiponje" }
```

In the same spirit, you will be able to declare methods without the `function`
keyword (this also apply for _getter_ and *setter*).

```js
const obj = {
  get email() {
    return this.email();
  },
  set email(email) {
    this.email = email;
  },
  validateEmail(email) {
    return true;
  }
};
```

## Dynamic property name

One last thing for _objects literal_ will allow you to create dynamic property
name using an expression, directly when you create an object. With ES5 you have
to do that in two steps:

```js
function action(type, data) {
  var payload = {};
  payload[type] = data;
  return payload;
}
```

Now with ES6, you can do:

```js
function action(type, data) {
  return {
    [type]: data
  };
}
```

**Note:** with dynamic properties, declaring multiples properties with the same
name is accepted and do not throw an error. Keep in mind that only the last
value will be kept.
