You probably know underscore or lodash `extend` method (at leat lodash right)?
Like most of these utilities functions, those are deprecated by an ES6 (ES2015)
feature.

# Object.assign

The new static method `Object.assign` take a bunch of objects as arguments :

* The first is a target for copies;
* Next are sources;
* All _own properties_ (enumerable keys and non inherited, even those which are
  `undefined`) will be copied in the target (so last ones take precedences);
* **The target object is modified** (it must be mutable);
* The modified target object is returned.

```js
const o = { y: 0 };
const o1 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
const o2 = { x: undefined, z: 3 };
Object.assign(o, o1, o2); // { x: undefined, y: 2, z: 3 }
o; // { x: undefined, y: 2, z: 3 }
o1; // unmodified
o2; // unmodified
```

## Becareful to mutability

Be warned that the target is always modified. Since the most frequent use-case
is the creation of a new object that will be generated from others sources, most
of the time we will pass an new empty object as the first parameter.

```js
const o1 = { x: 1 };
const o2 = { y: 2 };
const o = Object.assign({}, o1, o2);
o; // { x: 1, y: 2 }
// o1 and o2 are unmodified
```

## Specific use-cases

### Error during the copy

If a property in the target is read-only, `Object.assign` should behave like in
strict mode (unlike the _wtf_ mode) and throw an error before stoping the copy.

```js
const o = Object.create(
  {},
  {
    val: { value: 42, enumerable: true, writable: false }
  }
);

// "standard" (wtf) mode:
o.val = 0; // no error
o.val; // 42 (unmodified value)
Object.assign(o, { x: 1, val: 0, y: 2 }); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign…
o; // { val: 42, x: 1 }

// "strict" mode:
o.val = 0; // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign…
Object.assign(o, { x: 1, val: 0, y: 2 }); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign…
o; // { val: 42, x: 1 }
```

Keys that have already been copied before the throwing of the exception will be
kept in the target object, that's why in our example `x` have been copied but
not `y`.

Note: this is theory, but practise show us that this behavior is variable,
depending of the platform and the context, the error might not always be thrown.
To get a predictable behavior, you should work in _strict_ mode.

### Scalar sources

When sources are scalar values (number, boolean, etc) `Object.keys` will not
return any keys and values will be ignored. `null` and `undefined` will also be
ignored.

Particular case: strings are treated as array.

```js
const o = {};
Object.assign(o, 1, true, null, "toto", ["b", "a"], undefined);
// 1, true, null, undefined are ignored
// "toto" is converted to {0: "t", 1: "o", 2: "t", 3: "o"}
// ["b", "a"] is converted to {0: "b", 1: "a"}
o; // {0: "b", 1: "a", 2: "t", 3: "o"}
```

## Conclusion

We can forget `_.clone`, `_.extend` and friends with this method!

About compatiblity, `Object.assign` is pretty well supported by all modern
browsers (IE is not considered as modern until 12) :

* Edge (IE ≥ 12) ;
* Chrome stable (46) ;
* Firefox stable (42) ;
* Node ≥ 4 ;
* If you need to support old browsers, you will need [Babel](http://babeljs.io)
  or one of many users implementations.
